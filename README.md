# 🧠 Problem Statement

Modern influencer marketing campaigns often suffer from:

- inefficient budget allocation
- unclear ROI attribution
- platform saturation
- changing audience behavior
- lack of explainability

InfluenceIQ Engine solves this by combining:

✅ optimization  
✅ explainable AI  
✅ scenario simulation  
✅ model monitoring  
✅ retraining pipelines  

into a unified ML platform.

# 🚀 Core Features

## 💰 Creator Campaign Optimizer

Users provide a campaign budget and the system determines the optimal allocation across:

- TikTok
- Instagram
- YouTube

using:

- Scipy constrained optimization
- diminishing return modeling
- budget caps
- marginal ROI analysis

---

## 🧠 Explainable AI

The platform uses SHAP to explain:

- why predictions changed
- which platform contributes most
- feature-level impact
- creator niche influence

Includes:

- SHAP Summary Plots
- Waterfall Analysis
- Feature Contribution Visualization

---

## ⚠️ Drift Monitoring

Built-in monitoring system detects:

- concept drift
- distribution shifts
- rising residual errors
- unstable prediction regions

Includes:

- rolling MAE analysis
- residual tracking
- feature distribution monitoring
- outlier validation

---

## 🔄 Retraining Workflow

The app supports:

- CSV upload
- schema validation
- automated retraining
- before-vs-after metric comparison
- model replacement

---

## 📊 Time-Series ML Validation

Instead of naive random splits, the system uses:

```python
TimeSeriesSplit
```

to avoid:
- temporal leakage
- unrealistic validation
- future information contamination
